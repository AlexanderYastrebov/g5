# g5: An R5RS implementation in Go

`g5` is a simple implementation of Scheme written in Go that aims to be fully
compliant with the R5RS standard.  It is currently still missing some things,
but is functional.  It supports features often excluded from minimal scheme
implementations, such as proper R5RS macros.  It also supports a few extensions
and SRFIs.

It is licensed under the BSD-0 license, effectively making it public domain.
Use it however you wish.
